									<h3>Stevan Dupor -- Founder</h3>
									<p style="text-indent: 15px">Thank you for your interest in DuporDesign! My name is Stevan Dupor, and I founded the company in 2009 to bring my love for technology and the performing arts to the greater Triangle area. I trained academically as an Electrical Engineer (Go Wolfpack!) but never forgot my love for the performing arts and live music. I discovered a niche in the Raleigh area for production support backed by a strong technical foundation, and executed with an eye and ear for the aesthetic needs of live shows and events. Thus, DuporDesign was born.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 15px">Since we make live events for the <i>people</i> in attendence, I believe the <i>people</i> making the event happen are the most important resource. Our staff is comprised of the most skilled and diverse population of technicians and artisans available regionally so that your event is executed with technical ease, so that you can concentrate on your guests and audience members. Our sound engineers, lighting designers, video technicians, and general event staff are carefully selected for each event based on the format and requirements of the event for maximum efficacy. </p>

							<p style="text-indent: 15px">When designing a concept for an event, I believe our support of your broad vision and plan is key. We always work from a comprehensive set of CAD documentation created for each event, and use all available design information to ensure our portion of your event stays on-brand. This can include swatches and color schemes from a planner, color information from decor & linen vendors, and information we receive directly from you as part of the planning process. Naturally, staying flexible is also important, and we are always prepared to "think on our feet" when faced with unexpected challenges on-site. </p>
							<p style="text-indent: 15px">I believe process and technical support are key to a successful event. We follow a process-based planning system that has been developed over years of shows and events which helps to identify and prevent potential issues before they arise. Following the process also ensures that we are deploying safe systems and abiding by all professional, safety, and fire codes. I am generally available on-site to support the teams and systems we provide, and you will often find me working closely with our teams to realize your event vision. Since almost all of our systems are computer-controlled, and many presentations are backed up by video and software, my electrical & computer engineering background lends itself well to technical support on-site. I am also a Microsoft Certified Professinal and Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator, so I am happy to provide support for any computing-based aspects of your presentation. </p>
							<p style="text-indent: 15px">As Steve Jobs so aptly expressed, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." I deeply enjoy bringing solid technology and skilled people together to deliver a client's message, which makes it easy to keep our production quality top-notch. I look forward to hearing from you about your next event.</p>
